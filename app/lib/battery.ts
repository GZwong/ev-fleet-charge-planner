 * Calculate the charge time of a battery given its capacity, charging power
 * and start & end SOC.
 *
 * Implementation: Splits the charging into two phases:
 * 1. Constant current phase (0% to 80%) - the capacity increases with constant power
 * 2. Constant voltage phase (80% to 100%) - the capacity increases logarithmically as it approaches 100%
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * 1. Charging is 90% efficient
 * 2. Charging time from 80% to 99% is as long as 0 to 80%.
 *
 * @param SOC_start - Starting SOC before charging in decimals [-]
 * @param SOC_end - SOC reached at the end of charge in decimals [-]
 * @param capacity - Total battery capacity [kWh]
 * @param chargePower - Rate of charge [kW]
 * @param chargeEfficiency - (Optional) Charge Efficiency [-]. Default to 0.9
 * @returns Charging time [hours]
